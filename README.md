LegalSeg: Unlocking the Structure of Indian Legal Judgements Through Rhetorical Role classification.
The primary problem addressed in this work is the automatic segmentation of Indian legal judgments into rhetorical roles such as Facts, Issue, Arguments, Reasoning, Decision, and None. Legal judgments are lengthy, complex, and unstructured, making it difficult for lawyers, researchers, and citizens to extract key information efficiently. Traditional methods and small-scale datasets have proven insufficient for capturing the intricacies of legal language and the sequential flow of arguments. As a result, there is a strong need for a large annotated dataset and advanced NLP models that can accurately classify sentences into rhetorical roles. Solving this problem will improve legal research, enable better summarization, and support the development of automated decision-making systems in the legal domain
